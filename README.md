## My process

To carry out this challenge I used the GRID property to arrange the elements on the page in the best possible way, and from then on I started positioning the elements and defining their spacing, sizes and styles, it is very likely that the way I wrote the code can be improved , but I still found it very easy to execute the challenge this way.

I had difficulties when styling certain elements, as I couldn't think of a way to put the ideas I had into the code, however, I liked the result.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I can put the use of the Grid and Flex properties into practice, and I believe I managed to make good use of them.
